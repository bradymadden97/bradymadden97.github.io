I've finally gotten around to writing about my first trip since being abroad: PARIS! I've been meaning to write about this weekend for over a week now, but as soon as I got home, my class turned around the next day and headed to Sweden for half a week and I just haven't had free time and energy to write at the same moment since!

So Emily and I met up in Paris in what I now will call the "flu game of vacations". Confused? See <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_NBA_Finals#Game_5:_The_Flu_Game">Michael Jordan Flu Game</a>. Somehow, despite being pretty under the weather, Emily let me drag her around to basically every major thing-to-see in Paris in the span of three days! We started off Friday at Musée d'Orsay because it was new for both of us and it had come _highly_ recommended. Some people I know pretty well even said they spent SEVEN hours there one time ;-). We saw an awesome Degas exhibit, I was a big fan of the horse sculptures.

We ventured into the huge hall of impressionist art, definitely the area we were most excited to see! I was pretty proud of myself for recognizing a lot of the artists names and even some specific paintings! I'm pretty sure we have a magnet of this one on the fridge back home...

Some of my other favorites was this one by Caillebotte and these church paintings by Monet. They looked to me like a big church made out of dripping candle wax.

We also took a selfie with another fridge magnet from back home!

After Orsay we crossed the river again and went to an apparently new-ish Paris attraction, the Ferris wheel! The view was too good to waste time taking pictures but we could see everything from the top - the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and finally the Eiffel Tower! Definitely would recommend the Ferris wheel, unless you're with someone who keeps asking you "what would you do if this thing tipped over right now".

Also on Friday, stopped by Angelina's for the hot chocolate - WOW, that is definitely the most fancy place I've been just to have a hot chocolate! They had full on waiters and white tables inside a beautiful room just for these drinks! Also that was definitely not American hot chocolate (chocolate and milk). That was literally hot. melted. chocolate. We apparently were supposed to add sugar ourselves in case the chocolate wasn't sweet enough but I was afraid I might spontaneously get diabetes if I did that.


Saturday morning we tried to hit a "great weekend brunch" recommendation only to find out that they only have said "great weekend bunch" on Sundays!! So, by this time it was French lunch time apparently and we ended up with escargot on our plates for our first meal of the day. Bon Appétit.

Saturday was a little unfortunate because it rained literally the whole day, but we still made the most of it and saw the Jardin du Luxembourg, Notre Dame, and Sainte Chappelle. Sainte Chappelle was absolutely amazing to me, the fact that over 70% of the stained glass in that church was almost 1000 years old. Notre Dame was massive but also the most touristy church I've ever seen! Very strange to see shops and stores right next to church pews.

We also checked out Shakespeare and Company book store right near the two churches. It was full of probably thousands of books and every room was shaped a little differently, which I thought was really interesting. It used to house famous writers, Ernest Hemingway lived there for a bit! 

At night we finally hit the main attraction and went up in the Eiffel Tower! Even though we got there too late and could only go up to the second level, the view was still great and the light show while up there was stunning! I definitely think the Tower looks better at night.

Exhausted from two days of nonstop walking and sightseeing, we of course had to power through on Sunday and climb up to the highest point in Paris, Montmartre! There we got an amazing view of the city, in the sunlight this time (!!) and went inside Sacré-Cœur, the basilica at the top of the hill. The view, the harp player playing on the steps, and of course the people trying to sell us selfie sticks all made the morning very memorable.

Last on our list was the Arc de Triomphe, which we metro'ed to but didn't quite have time to go up in before I had to make a mad dash to the airport. Someone's gotta tell these cities to stop building their airports so far outside the city!! I'm still so happy about how much we got to see and do over the whole weekend, and the number of awesome food spots we hit too that I don't think I even mentioned too much. There's still so much more to see in Paris, I know the Louvre and the Catacombs will be on my list for the next time around.

Time to get ready for the next trip - Dublin!

Au revoir,
