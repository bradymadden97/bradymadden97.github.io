As awful as I&#39;ve been about writing/posting this semester I told myself I had to do one for my spring break trip or else I would definitely start forgetting stuff! Well, what an unreal week. I called (for warm, sunny weather) and the Iberian Peninsula loudly answered! This was my final trip of the semester before heading home - REAL home, not the &quot;home&quot; that I call Copenhagen in texts sometimes, sorry Mom - and it would be hard to say it wasn&#39;t the best one yet! It was my spring break week from DIS so I left Thursday night for Barcelona and came back the following Saturday from Lisbon. In the middle I stopped in Porto, another city in Portugal, and even managed a few hours (waffles) in Brussels during a layover. This post may be long, or it may be bulleted, I don&#39;t know how many words my engineering brain can handle and I have to save room for some real school papers due this week (gasp)!



**BARCELONA**

Barcelona: _the land of the_ people who don&#39;t actually speak Spanish _and the home of the_ pickpockets. I had a few goals heading into this city and some were more accomplished than others.

#1 - Don&#39;t get everything you own stolen. Status: Accomplished! Barcelona is known as one of the cities with the highest rate of pickpocketing in Europe and I was hoping to bring down that rate a notch if possible. I&#39;m giving credit to the inner pocket in my jacket that I found right as the trip started - &#39;twas the real MVP.

#2 - Impress everyone with your four years of high school Spanish education. Status: Not Accomplished. First wrench in this plan came when I learned Barcelona was part of Catalonia - the section of Spain that recently has been trying to SECEDE from Spain. They also use their own dialect/language called Catalonian which, while being kinda similar to Spanish for some words, can also vary drastically. Lots of x&#39;s instead of ch&#39;s? I guess it&#39;s a pretty big deal considering Catalonian is on Google Translate. I _do_ think I impressed Daniel when I called the Airbnb before the trip and said &quot;Hola, habla ingles por favor?&quot; LOL. He kinda glanced up from his computer with a shocked face.

#3 - Eat some paella. Status: Accomplished - as part of Spanish Tapas dinner aka one of the best meals of my young life. In fact, Barcelona in general gifted us with some absolutely unreal brunches, gelato&#39;s, sangrias, and dinners!

#4, #5, #6 - Check out the main sights, lay on the beach, catch up with friends! Status: ¡Tres cumplidos! We saw fake Sagrada Familia, followed by real Sagrada Familia, Gaudi architecture, a famous Barcelona beach nightclub, and a high view of the city. The beach laying was short-lived due to the fact that 3/4 of us are VPP (very pale people) and 2 of those very pale people have been living in Denmark for the past 3 months aka The Land of No Sun. Say no to skin cancer, say yes to SPF. We also said no, no, and no again to the many people trying to sell us anything and everything on the beach!! They would not leave us alone! Blankets, massages, mojitos, cerveza, henna (Emily fell for this one and immediately regretted it) - it definitely was not a quiet, relaxing beach experience. By far the best part of this city was the people! I&#39;ve obviously seen Emily a few times this semester but I had not seen Sarah and hadn&#39;t seen Carolyn very much at all despite her being in Copenhagen with me. It was really awesome just to spend some time with familiar UVA faces.

Other things:

- A travel-first for me: eating at the same brunch place twice! Carolyn, Emily and I ate at Milk the first morning, all got Huevos Rancheros, and loved it so much that we brought Sarah back here on Sunday. This was my first exposure to Spanish/Portugese food prices (hint: cheap!) and was very much welcomed after a semester in Copenhagen (hint: not cheap lol!).
- We hit the jackpot on our Airbnb, much due apparently to my incessant questioning! Backstory: we booked rooms in a larger shared apartment on Airbnb, but some of the reviews made me follow up with the host to ensure we could lock our passports up during the day. Apparently this question was enough to make her think I was one of those hyper-intense, bothersome guests so when we arrived she told us that we had been &quot;upgraded&quot; to an entire apartment to ourselves for the same price! Score one for asking questions :)

Now… pictures and short blurbs!

Next stop via a much-too-early flight:

**PORTO**

Porto: The city with the least amount of writing on our Google Doc of &quot;Things to do&quot;. All it said - &quot;Port wine&quot;. We didn&#39;t know really anything about this city coming in but it turned out to be a huge win! List of W&#39;s taken in Oporto aka &quot;_The Port_&quot;.

-  **First Hostel experience.** Emily &quot;I spent the night in a hostel that doubled as a homeless shelter in London and lived to tell about it&quot; Drake took the reigns on Porto housing and Carolyn and I got to check &quot;Sleeping in a room with 5 strangers&quot; off our study abroad bucket lists. Didn&#39;t know &quot;Sleeping in a room with 5 strangers&quot; was on my study abroad bucket list, but now it is checked off. I have to call this hostel experience a win because despite the downsides of having to lock your stuff up before you go down the hall to the bathroom for five seconds, or the weirdness of sharing rooms with complete strangers of all ages, I would definitely stay in a hostel again. It was a great price, it was mostly young travelers just like myself, and it led us to a lot of really great activities perfect for young travelers. Such as....
-  **Porto walking tour**. This was the first thing we did upon arrival in Porto because it was recommended by the hostel and oh, let&#39;s not forget that we had absolutely nothing planned for this city besides one measly &quot;Port wine&quot;. For context by the way, Barcelona had at least 3 pages of recommendations. Our tour guide ran us so ragged around this city that we had to tap out after 2 hours at the coffee shop break. I blame the fact that Copenhagen is as flat as a pancake. Portugal is like the San Francisco of Europe! Before stopping off we did see some beautiful examples of Portuguese Azulejo tiles, which cover many of the buildings around the city. Apparently tiling the outside of the building helped reflect some sun and keep the inside cooler. Every building had a different, beautiful tile pattern!
-  **Port wine + port wine tour**. I&#39;d like to think I learned a lot here - for someone who knows almost nothing about wine. Some fast facts: \*Warning - if you already know your wines, save yourself the agony of reading these possibly misremembered fast facts and skip down\*
  - Oporto, or &quot;The Port&quot; was the landing place for ships carrying the grapes from the eastern Douro valley of Portugal - hence the name of the wine
  - There are two types of red ports - Ruby and Tawny. All red ports, at least at this Burmester winery we toured, age for 4-6 years. If they are bottled and drank, they are Ruby. If they are transferred to smaller barrels, they can age for 10, 20, 40 or more years and are called Tawny.
  - The longer red ports stay in the wooden barrels, the more tannins it takes in and the lighter it becomes in color. The longer white ports stay in the wooden barrels, the darker it becomes in color. Eventually, the two can look almost indistinguishable!
  - Port wine is heavy on the sugar and on the alcohol. The ones we tasted were 19.6% ABV.
  - The Bulgarian couple that we did the tasting with turned out to live in Fairfax and have two daughters that graduated from UVA! They were not nearly as shocked as I was at this news. The world is officially too small.
-  **Matosinhos**. Porto is not on the ocean, rather on like an inlet/ river type of thing. We took a bus out to this city to see a modern art museum and catch a quick glimpse of America across the pond. This beach was a stark difference from the touristy, loud beach in Barcelona. I felt like I was invading someone&#39;s neighborhood. I think we were the only tourists in Matosinhos, which was a really cool feeling! We got drinks at a bar on the beach and then sat and watched the surfers and the sunset. The waves were actually really huge - much bigger than the US side of the Atlantic. It was peaceful and warm. We then headed to dinner at - and I will plug this restaurant name on the off chance that anyone reading this ever goes to Matosinhos, Portugal, it was that good - Restaurante Lage do Senhor do Padrão. This place was the win of wins!! Our uber driver tipped us off on this one, fresh seafood caught right in the city. Seeing fresh fish on the menu for under 10 euros is a college student&#39;s dream come true. Fish (swordfish), appetizer (shrimp), wine, dessert, vegetables, and we paid under $20 per person!
-  **Zenith brunch**. More food, but this story is too good not to tell. We stumbled in this place for brunch Tuesday morning and it turned out to be American brunch central! Eggs benedict with avocado and bacon, pancakes with ice cream on them, protein shakes, acai bowls, freshly squeezed orange juice - these things you just don&#39;t see in Europe! Europeans stick to their tiny shot of espresso and bread 10 ways - croissant, baguette, pastry, etc… To get to the point, this brunch place was much needed - so good that when we paid I asked, with a small amount of hope in my heart, if it was a chain. It was not. However, the waiter said, &quot;we&#39;re opening a second restaurant in Lisbon tomorrow&quot;. That was quite a sweet phrase to my ears considering we had a train booked to Lisbon for tomorrow! More on _Zenith: The Sequel_, later.

And, some pics of a beautiful two days!

Just a train ride this time….

**LISBON**

Lisbon: Porto&#39;s older, more established, more touristy, brother. Still complete with tight, steep, cobblestone streets that were probably built by a maniac or someone who didn&#39;t envision cars. By this point in the semester, my phone had been sending me warnings saying &quot;Alert - Can&#39;t take any more pictures of churches - Alert&quot;. We were hoping to find some different kinds of activities and sites to see and started with perhaps the most spontaneous, unlikely thing Emily and I have ever paid for:

-  **Being driven around the city in a golf cart**. I still don&#39;t know if we got &quot;got&quot;, by the super nice young driver lady, or if this was the perfect activity for us without a lot planned for the afternoon, but I definitely know I enjoyed it. One minute we were wandering across the main square in Lisbon, enjoying the beautiful weather, and the next we were zooming up steep cobblestone hills, laughing at the walkers huffing and puffing. Just kidding, I have been the walker many a time on vacation and it is great! The effort always makes the view even sweeter. But in this case the lack of effort and the increased number of views was pretty sweet too. Our tour guide took us to the Santa Justa elevator and led us to the back entrance to skip the line and get a breathtaking view of the city, then to a very ornate Baroque church, a few other vistas, and a spot for dinner. Along the way she gave us some tips on other Lisbon neighborhoods, where to go out, and told us the famous Yellow Trams were full of _pickpockets!_ The police even know _who_ the common pickpockets are but apparently do nothing to stop them. We stayed away.

Anyways, that was our possibly-a-tourist-trap experience.

Thursday, we met up with Colette and Isabel from Emily&#39;s Lyon program and went back to our favorite brunch spot ZENITH! I took great pride in telling the waitress that we had just been to the one in Porto two days before. We balled out and got french toast, pancakes, and eggs benedict. Maybe they will pick to expand to Charlottesville, Virginia next \*crossing fingers\*. I&#39;ll keep the rest of the synopsis on this day as brief as the visits we made to some sights in Lisbon :/. Still trying to figure out people who pay hundreds of dollars for plane tickets but won&#39;t pay 3 euros to see the inside of the monument they just walked to? I don&#39;t like having pictures on my phone of landmarks or monuments that I didn&#39;t take the time to go inside and learn more about. Emily and I were kind of relieved to be back doing our own thing for the last day.

**SINTRA**

Sintra: The City Formerly Known As Disneyland Portugal. This was a day trip away from Lisbon and was recommended by one of my roommates at DIS, as well as a bunch of stuff online. When we arrived in the city we were immediately bombarded by tour companies trying to sell us all different sorts of tours. Sintra is full of old Portuguese castles but they&#39;re all high up in the mountains and not walkable. I almost fell for the man selling us a tiny electric car that we could &quot;drive ourselves wherever we wanted to see&quot; but Emily smartly vetoed that. We opted for the bus and headed up the mountain.

Quick shoutout to the bus driver for whipping this giant bus through tight curves all the way up this mountain. Less of a shoutout to the same bus driver for telling us to get off at the &quot;next stop&quot; when it turned out we definitely did not want to get off at the &quot;next stop&quot;.

Anyways, our first real stop was the Castelo dos Mouros - The Castle of the Moors. Quick fact: The Moors occupied Portugal before the Portuguese and have left a lot of influence on the city. &quot;Al&quot; in Arabic means &quot;The&quot;, which is why a lot of Portuguese neighborhoods have names beginning with &quot;Al&quot;, such as the famous old district &quot;Alfama&quot;. This castle was frankly just right up my alley - hiking through nature up to a really high up beautiful view? That&#39;s vacation 101. This castle was from like 1000. I&#39;ll let the pictures say the rest but it was really really neat.

	</div>
</p>

Next stop was the Pena Palace aka the palace that fully convinces you that you&#39;re in some kind of Disneyland alternate universe if you&#39;re not already convinced. I mean, this place was all tourists no locals and painted bright yellow and blue! The inside was stunning as well with really ornate wall decorations and paintings. We got a kick out of all the tourists taking pictures of a poor worker restoring tiles. He should wear a sign saying &quot;Not part of the exhibit&quot;.

</p>

Mom would have loved the last palace/gardens we stopped at - not kidding there was like at least 6 palaces in this city - because it was built on a hill and seemed to have a bunch of secret passages. I was actually a huge fan as well and was trying to picture why people would need to be sneaking around this complex. One more mini mini church to send my phone over the edge.

We truly overexerted ourselves on this day and had aspirations of the beach and cliffs overlooking the Atlantic but the sun was setting on our vacation. Back in Sintra downtown for dinner we ended up walking into a really cute restaurant and somehow getting a table! I think every other person that walked in after us had made a reservation. This dinner, and all the amazing food this week in general left me like:

	</div>
</p>



And that&#39;s about it! If you made it all the way through this one I'm shocked or you're my parents lol. I can&#39;t be thankful enough for the amazing company I was with all week, the weather we lucked out with, the great food and the recommendations- I think I&#39;ll be reliving this vacation through pictures for a long time.

Adiós and tchau,

Brady
