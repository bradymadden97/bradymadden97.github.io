Family and friends (and the occasional stranger),

Welcome to my blog! We'll see how well I keep this up over the coming months - remember, I haven't taken an english class since June of 2015! One thing engineering does not prepare you for is writing more than equations and code - my three-page chemistry lab report took me an entire night to finish during first year. 

But I have high hopes for this blog and I have some jumbled ideas for it too: do I write about projects I've worked on, do I only write about my life and adventures while abroad? Right now everything is in one place, we'll see how that works out!

More coming soon!
