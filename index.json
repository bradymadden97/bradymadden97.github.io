My apartment has kept me very busy but I\u0026rsquo;m thankful I\u0026rsquo;ve met some people that are really into going out and having a good time. My wallet is uncertain how it feels after quite an expensive first week. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely glad it\u0026rsquo;s Sunday and pretty much nobody has an excuse to go out tonight.\nLike I mentioned in the last post, I live literally in the center of the city. Charlottesville has the corner, the strip of bars all in very close proximity to each other where everyone goes out \u0026ndash; I basically live on the corner of Copenhagen - but with about 10x as many bars, and a bunch of clubs. Most of which close far after 2AM. Cue Adam and I sadly sitting awake at 4:30 last night listening to the club music 30 feet from our beds. We\u0026rsquo;ve been able to hit a bunch of different bars in our direct area and have even started venturing out past the nearby streets where the bars are less Americanized and more authentic \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m really enjoying trying to meet Danes and they always are so intrigued by Americans! A lot of them can\u0026rsquo;t understand why I would leave America to come to Denmark for a semester.\n My room! My corner is the one in the middle.\nThose blackout curtains have been helping us sleep in till noon.   Since my last post, I\u0026rsquo;ve completed my first - and only - day of class here. It\u0026rsquo;s quite weird being here for over a week now and having spent less than 5 hours doing anything school related! My first class on Thursday was at 11:40 AM and I was able to get up and work out at the gym in the morning beforehand which made me feel really productive. I was again so thankful for my location when I left my apartment at 11:31 to walk to class, and learned others had ridden trains for over 40 minutes! I\u0026rsquo;m sure my life would be a lot different this semester if I lived that far away.\nAnyways, my first class was Danish and we started by talking about some of the biggest culture shocks we\u0026rsquo;ve faced so far. I mentioned how the transit systems here are kind of on the honor system and how that definitely would never work in America. Here, you have a transit card with money on it that you tap on a sensor as you board and depart any metro, train, or bus around the city. It\u0026rsquo;s a great system that is very easy and transitions well between all the different modes of transportation. The interesting thing is, there isn\u0026rsquo;t any turnstiles or barriers blocking you from taking the transportation without paying! Ticket-checkers will occasionally come by and make sure you actually \u0026ldquo;tapped-on\u0026rdquo; but I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a lot yet and I know I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally taken at least one ride without paying. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the statistics of how many Danes free-load off the transportation here but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I could say that this system would fail in the States. Back in class, we also learned about some \u0026ldquo;culture no-no\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; in Denmark. Some interesting ones I learned:\n Danes do not like to chit-chat like Americans. They say \u0026ldquo;Hej\u0026rdquo; (Hi) and expect the same in return - different than America where we usually say \u0026ldquo;Hey, how are you doing?\u0026rdquo; just to be polite. Catharina (my professor), said that if we ask a Dane how they are doing, expect them to actually answer the question with a long response! Professors here want to be called by their first name. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s disrespectful to call them \u0026ldquo;Professor\u0026rdquo;. Danes really don\u0026rsquo;t like people who talk loudly, or really at all, on public transportation. Avoid yawning (I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what to think of this one because yawning is kind of an involutary reflex, but I had yawned like five times in her class already so I felt bad when I heard this) Ask dog owners permission to pet their dog before doing so. They think it\u0026rsquo;s very strange for strangers to be touching their dog!  Later that night, all I could do is shake my head as the people around me violated basically every \u0026ldquo;culture no-no\u0026rdquo; on this list! I almost laughed out loud when a kid started petting a woman\u0026rsquo;s dog on the street and she just stared at him in alarm. Sorry, we\u0026rsquo;re just clueless Americans!\nFriday night we decided to treat ourselves and go out to eat for dinner, because, we hadn\u0026rsquo;t put a big enough dent in our bank accounts or anything yet right? Daniel, Nate, Justin and I walked down Strøget to Mama Rosa, since we all were craving mexican food. I got a pretty great enchilada and tried my first Moscow Mule! We were all very disappointed they did not come in the copper mugs as I expected. I really appreciated Dad\u0026rsquo;s words of wisdom on the drink - \u0026ldquo;Be careful, a few of those will kick you in the ass (like a mule!)\u0026rdquo;. Good line, but no way was I paying for a few of those.\n Mama Rosa meal. I was a big fan of the cucumber in the drink!   After dinner, we met up with some more friends back at our apartment and eventually decided to venture out to the Meatpacking district of Copenhagen, to try out a club. The Meatpacking district is about 20 minutes southwest of the center of the city and we ended up at KB3 for my first Scandinavian club experience. This night ended up being probably one of the highlights of my nights out in Copenhagen so far - the DJs played some amazing Scandinavian music mixed in with some classic American songs, the lights and smoke effects were absolutely unreal and it felt like I was at an adult version of high school homecoming - which now that I write that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it really comes across as cool, but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to take my word for it that it was fun!\nThe next day I and others were itching to be tourists and not just college kids at bars during these four months so we hopped on the S-Tøg and trained about 45 minutes up the coast to Humlebæk to see the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. This museum was featured as one of the top-5 day trips from Copenhagen and it in fact has nothing to do with the Louisiana we in the US know. It\u0026rsquo;s namesake, I learned, is the three wives the founder of the museum had, all who were named Louise! The museum was right on the water and we actually could see Sweden across the way. It was the first time I\u0026rsquo;d seen water, grass, or really nature in general in a week and wow I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how much I needed it! Once we went inside there were some awesome exhibits and some very strange ones, including this \u0026ldquo;Anamazon\u0026rdquo; one which was literally a pile of dirt surrounded by 27 Amazon echos. The blue-green light inside the room was painful and the whole vibe was very creepy.\n Beautiful view with Sweden in the background. So nice to get out of the city for a bit.    This exhibit gave me nightmares. The Alexas were reading out every single product on Amazon in alphabetical order.   We also saw an Andy Warhol painting and a mesmerizing infinite-mirror light display. Afterwards, Daniel, Nate and I tried Denmark\u0026rsquo;s signature dish, smørrebrød, for the first time and it was not what I was expecting. I had heard smørrebrød was an open-faced sandwich, so I was expecting a regular sandwich with toppings and just the top bun missing for an unknown reason. Instead, this dish was more like rye bread with a heavy cream cheese-like spread that you put on the rye. The spread has different meats and vegetables mixed in and ours was a smoked salmon base. I was skeptical by the initial visual and I\u0026rsquo;m sure my Mom would absolutely hate it, but it was surpringly good! I was proud of myself for checking another Danish speciality off the list.\n Kusama Installation. We only were allowed a minute in here it was so popular!    Smoked Salmon Smørrebrød!    Andy Warhol   Humlebæk was a super interesting town and all the houses were exactly what I would expect from a small, Nordic village. It was pretty unreal to think about where I was and how just a week ago I was in my house in Centreville!\nI\u0026rsquo;m still looking forward to my Paris trip in a little less than two weeks and we\u0026rsquo;re possibly looking at taking the train to Stockholm next weekend! Copenhagen is great but the less weekend nights I sleep across from that club may be for the better!!\n#1 American thing I\u0026rsquo;m missing right now: definitely watching some college basketball, but UVA is still doing well!\nTill next time,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b0d8af86363bad22e00854309d935614","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"The City that Never Sleeps, or is that just me?","type":"article","url":"bradymadden97.github.io/article/the-city-that-never-sleeps/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"Hello from across the pond!\nIt has been a whirlwind first five-ish days in Copenhagen and I decided I needed to finally sit down and write about everything that\u0026rsquo;s happened before I forget! This is probably going to be too long but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to start with the basics:\n\nHousing\nI live in an apartment complex of all DIS students in the center of the city - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a name like a lot of the apartments in Charlottesville so we just call it by the street name: Skindergade. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure nobody has really figured out the correct pronunciation but I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about 50 different ones.\nThe complex is an interesting, almost-donut-shaped building with a tiny courtyard in the center that nobody would probably go in even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t 35 degrees outside. Each of the 5 levels has a communal kitchen and bathroom, and maybe 2 or 3 rooms. I\u0026rsquo;m on the ground floor, first door as you walk in. It\u0026rsquo;s really great because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to carry giant suitcases up the dollhouse-sized stairs. It\u0026rsquo;s really rough when I hear every single person walk in and out of the apartment. The Danish make their doors sturdy. And loud.\nSpeaking of my room, I\u0026rsquo;m in a triple - and the only triple I think I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of yet. I was really excited to hear about it and still am because I lucked out with two really nice guys. Adam is from Vandy and Nic is from Wisconsin. We have a second room in the back half of the ground floor with two guys from Georgetown and GW, and these two rooms are connected by our kitchen.\nSince the entrance to my room is near the front of the building and the main entrance to Matt and Nathaniel\u0026rsquo;s room is in the back, people pretty much always come and go through our door. Sometimes I feel like I sleep in a hallway.\nHowever, all-in-all, I definitely lucked out with housing. Walking out my door into the center of Copenhagen, being steps from class, and living with a bunch of nice guys is a great deal. I definitely think this location will make a lot of things a lot easier as the semester goes on. Things like\u0026hellip;\nExploring\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done a decent job of walking around and starting to learn the city so far, although I can\u0026rsquo;t really compare to the number of hours and miles walked during Madden family vacations! Luckily, I have four months here so I can space everything out a bit more.\nSunday was the first full day in the city, and our planned morning activity was a city scavenger hunt with our apartment complex. A few guys from my dorm and I ventured out to grab coffee beforehand at around 10 and the city was a ghost town! The streets were so silent I thought maybe we were breaking some Danish morning curfew.\n Strøget on an empty Sunday morning ft. my roommate Nic   The scavenger hunt had us wander around the city in hopes of gettings us familiar with our immediate neighborhood, and maybe some public transportation we could use. My group ended up hopping on a bus that took us in the exact opposite direction of our house for about 10 minutes before finally reaching the next stop. We must have crossed three different bodies of water in that bus ride and all my group could do was look out the window in dispair and think about the 30 degree temperature waiting for us on our now much longer walk back.\nLuckily, there were transit maps on the bus and let me tell you, the Danish put their 46.8% tax rate to good use by building a killer public transportation system! We hopped on the metro and in two stops we were back in the center of the city for a total of 12 kroner - otherwise known as 2 dollars. That thing made the DC metro look like it was designed and operated by a monkey.\nAlso during the scavenger hunt, we happened upon probably the most unusual thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far in Copenhagen:\n Your browser does not support the video tag.   I don\u0026rsquo;t have much more to say about it because I have no idea what its purpose is, but they were marching the next day too!\nHighlight of the day: \u0026ldquo;winning\u0026rdquo; the scavenger hunt and a 500 kroner gift card to Conditori La Glace: \u0026ldquo;the oldest and probably best confectionary in Denmark\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely excited to go check that out with my group and celebrate!\nMonday we headed over to Christiania, which is a neighborhood of Copenhagen, to walk around and test our metro skills a bit. It was still bitter cold that day and I began to question if I\u0026rsquo;d ever see the sun again.\n Beautiful canals of Christiania   Tuesday morning I ventured out on my own to wander around for a bit. We live right next to Strøget, the mile-long cobblestone shopping street that runs through the city. It is basically a window-shopper\u0026rsquo;s paradise and I can see a lot of money being spent their this semester.\nI ended up at the foot of Rundetaarn, a round tower attached to the back of a church. The views and potential pictures were screaming my name so I headed up the windy ramp. The views from the top definitely did not disappoint!\n Views from Rundetaarn  Spiraling ramp up to the top of Rundetaarn   ... This is more words in one place than my simple engineering brain can handle so we\u0026rsquo;re gonna move on to\u0026hellip;\nFinal Thoughts\nI\u0026rsquo;ve officially caught the travel fever, I think we all have. I have heard \u0026ldquo;I just spent the last 2 hours looking at flights to everywhere\u0026rdquo; at least 10 times in 5 days.\nSpeaking of travel, I\u0026rsquo;ve booked my first trip: Emily and I are meeting in Paris on Febuary 2nd to 4th! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to drag her to all the super touristy spots that she\u0026rsquo;s seen already :-)\nIt is not an exaggeration by any means that Danish people only wear black. I have a navy blue coat and I might as well be wearing neon for how much I feel like I stand out. Black is not dark clothes. Black is not navy, or dark green, or grey. Everyone wears black.\nGuessing at Danish words and their meaning is not a good idea. On my first food order I tried to be clever and order the \u0026ldquo;Pesto Sandwich\u0026rdquo; because the menu item said the words \u0026ldquo;pesto\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;brød\u0026rdquo; (bread). After 5 minutes of confusion the cashier was able to figure out what I was talking about and told me that menu item was actually \u0026ldquo;pasta salad\u0026rdquo;. Oops.\nFreezing on the tarmac in Amsterdam, amongst a bunch of foreigners, thousands of miles away from pretty much anyone you know makes you question what you got yourself into for the next four months.\n Contemplating life as I stand in the freezing wind   Danes may be the calmest people on the planet. We spent twenty minutes signing five people up for gym memberships and the next guy in line waited quietly the whole time to buy a protein bar. In America, I get mad about a slow customer ahead of me after about 30 seconds.\nOther proud accomplishment: successfully buying a SIM card and signing up for a phone plan that gives me 30 gigabytes of data for the month all for less than 30 dollars! Where can I get that plan back in the US\u0026hellip;\nTLDR\nRead it all! Life is good, Copenhagen is cold, beautiful, and expensive, class starts tomorrow and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to keep exploring and start traveling!\nTill next time,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"d9fd24281c2e1e647f6552e73b7cd106","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Welcome to Copenhagen","type":"article","url":"bradymadden97.github.io/article/welcome-to-copenhagen/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"The day has finally come to say goodbye to America for four months and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure my brain still doesn\u0026rsquo;t know I\u0026rsquo;m leaving or where I\u0026rsquo;m going yet. But here I am, terminal C of Dulles Airport. The international terminal.\n\nFor those unaware or maybe only semi-aware of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing until May, I\u0026rsquo;m headed to Copenhagen, Denmark to study at DIS - a Danish school for American college students. So maybe more like an extended European vacation with a side of coding assignments and intro-level Danish langauge classes? Three days of class and no Friday courses is really going to make that return to UVA in the fall pretty tough.\nAll kidding aside, my expectations for this semester are rising as fast as this plane I\u0026rsquo;m about to board. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to experiencing the largest culture shock of my life, learning to communicate in a foreign country, taking thousands of pictures, and finally learning how to pronounce the word \u0026ldquo;Beer\u0026rdquo; in Danish. It is spelled \u0026ldquo;øl\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss trying to sound that one out.\nIn addition to becoming a veteran of Copenhagen, I want to visit London, Paris, Berlin, Iceland, Norway, Budapest, Amsterdam, Cinque Terre, Lisbon, Ireland\u0026hellip;! Who knows how feasible that is, but like I said, expectations are high. Some of those southern countries are a must since Copenhagen has an average temperature hovering around freezing and gets basically no daylight in the winter. At least I\u0026rsquo;ve finally found the place where my pale skin won\u0026rsquo;t stand out so much! These are my people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really so thankful to be able to take this experience and I\u0026rsquo;m looking to make the absolute most out of every day, and every bite of Smørrebrød (some kind of Danish sandwich with bread on only one side! No wonder Europeans are so much healthier than Americans). I can\u0026rsquo;t say a big enough thank you to my parents for helping me make this happen in every way - even driving a Uhaul to Charlottesville and moving my queen-sized bed out of my 5th floor apartment didn\u0026rsquo;t crush this dream.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll miss Charlottesville and UVa a ton, all the people there and the awesome events in the spring.

I loved the idea of a program being able to create something that looked like art, algorithmically, and was looking for a way to replicate it myself.\n\n\nI decided to use Go as the language after being exposed to it for the first time at work, and was hoping to learn more. The project definitely had its fair share of challenges, and I worked through a few different iterations in order to make it as efficient as I could.\nThe general process behind the art is to take in an image and calculate the average pixel color across the entire image. That color is replaces the image area, acting as if the image was severely blurred. The algorithm iterates by splitting the original image into 4 equal quadrants and calculating each quadrant\u0026rsquo;s average pixel color, then replacing that quadrant\u0026rsquo;s image with the color.\n Once the total image has at least 4 quadrants, the error between the average pixel color and the actual pixel values is calculated for each quadrant and the quadrant with the largest error is quad-split again.\nTo keep track of the current quadrant with the largest pixel error I stored each image struct in a heap. The image structs hold data about the dimensions of the quadrant image, the average pixel color, and the upper-left point of the quadrant in relation to the main image.\nIn addition, each image struct contains a histogram of the RGBA values of each pixel in the quadrant. Storing this array of integers performed faster than storing actual sub-images and extracting pixel values each iteration.\nThe total quadrant pixel error is derived by using the following formula across across the quadrant pixel histogram:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^p (r_i - \\overline{r})^2 + (g_i - \\overline{g})^2 + (b_i - \\overline{b})^2 $$\nwhere $p$ is the number of pixels in the quadrant, $\\overline{r}$, $\\overline{g}$, and $\\overline{b}$ are the average RGB values of the quadrant.\nAfter each iteration, the new quadrants are superimposed over the current main image at the correct position corresponding to the upper-left point stored in the quadrant image struct.\nGo-quads is compiled as an executable program that can be run with flags specifying certain parameters such as the number of iterations to run the quad-splitting algorithm, border, and background colors.\n\nAn additional feature is the ability to display the quadrants as circles instead of squares. Instead of drawing an entire quadrant with one average pixel color, the pixels in the quadrant will be given one of two designations - inside the radius or outside the radius. Pixels inside the radius will be colored with the average pixel color for that quadrant and pixels outside the radius will be colored with the background color.\nThis project produced some really interesting images and was definitely a good learning experience with Go and image processing.
