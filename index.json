But here I am, terminal C of Dulles Airport. The international terminal.\n\nFor those unaware or maybe only semi-aware of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing until May, I\u0026rsquo;m headed to Copenhagen, Denmark to study at DIS - a Danish school for American college students. So maybe more like an extended European vacation with a side of coding assignments and intro-level Danish langauge classes? Three days of class and no Friday courses is really going to make that return to UVA in the fall pretty tough.\nAll kidding aside, my expectations for this semester are rising as fast as this plane I\u0026rsquo;m about to board. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to experiencing the largest culture shock of my life, learning to communicate in a foreign country, taking thousands of pictures, and finally learning how to pronounce the word \u0026ldquo;Beer\u0026rdquo; in Danish. It is spelled \u0026ldquo;øl\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss trying to sound that one out.\nIn addition to becoming a veteran of Copenhagen, I want to visit London, Paris, Berlin, Iceland, Norway, Budapest, Amsterdam, Cinque Terre, Lisbon, Ireland\u0026hellip;! Who knows how feasible that is, but like I said, expectations are high. Some of those southern countries are a must since Copenhagen has an average temperature hovering around freezing and gets basically no daylight in the winter. At least I\u0026rsquo;ve finally found the place where my pale skin won\u0026rsquo;t stand out so much! These are my people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really so thankful to be able to take this experience and I\u0026rsquo;m looking to make the absolute most out of every day, and every bite of Smørrebrød (some kind of Danish sandwich with bread on only one side! No wonder Europeans are so much healthier than Americans). I can\u0026rsquo;t say a big enough thank you to my parents for helping me make this happen in every day - down to driving a Uhaul to Charlottesville and moving my queen-sized bed out of my 5th floor apartment.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll miss Charlottesville and UVa a ton, all the people there and the awesome events in the spring. But you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to find me up at 2AM cheering on UVa basketball from six hours ahead!\nLooking forward to the experience of a lifetime\u0026hellip;\nIndtil næste gang,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"019828331856f048cb1683105e297e66","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Its Happening","type":"article","url":"bradymadden97.github.io/article/its-happening/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Projects","Go","Art","Quad heaps","Open source"],"content":"Go-quads was a project I started after finding a similar algorithmic art program online, by @fogleman. I loved the idea of a program being able to create something that looked like art, algorithmically, and was looking for a way to replicate it myself.\n\n\nI decided to use Go as the language after being exposed to it for the first time at work, and was hoping to learn more. The project definitely had its fair share of challenges, and I worked through a few different iterations in order to make it as efficient as I could.\nThe general process behind the art is to take in an image and calculate the average pixel color across the entire image. That color is replaces the image area, acting as if the image was severely blurred. The algorithm iterates by splitting the original image into 4 equal quadrants and calculating each quadrant\u0026rsquo;s average pixel color, then replacing that quadrant\u0026rsquo;s image with the color.\n Once the total image has at least 4 quadrants, the error between the average pixel color and the actual pixel values is calculated for each quadrant and the quadrant with the largest error is quad-split again.\nTo keep track of the current quadrant with the largest pixel error I stored each image struct in a heap. The image structs hold data about the dimensions of the quadrant image, the average pixel color, and the upper-left point of the quadrant in relation to the main image.\nIn addition, each image struct contains a histogram of the RGBA values of each pixel in the quadrant. Storing this array of integers performed faster than storing actual sub-images and extracting pixel values each iteration.\nThe total quadrant pixel error is derived by using the following formula across across the quadrant pixel histogram:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^p (r_i - \\overline{r})^2 + (g_i - \\overline{g})^2 + (b_i - \\overline{b})^2 $$\nwhere $p$ is the number of pixels in the quadrant, $\\overline{r}$, $\\overline{g}$, and $\\overline{b}$ are the average RGB values of the quadrant.\nAfter each iteration, the new quadrants are superimposed over the current main image at the correct position corresponding to the upper-left point stored in the quadrant image struct.\nGo-quads is compiled as an executable program that can be run with flags specifying certain parameters such as the number of iterations to run the quad-splitting algorithm, border, and background colors.\n\nAn additional feature is the ability to display the quadrants as circles instead of squares. Instead of drawing an entire quadrant with one average pixel color, the pixels in the quadrant will be given one of two designations - inside the radius or outside the radius. Pixels inside the radius will be colored with the average pixel color for that quadrant and pixels outside the radius will be colored with the background color.\nThis project produced some really interesting images and was definitely a good learning experience with Go and image processing.
