I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write about this weekend for over a week now, but as soon as I got home, my class turned around the next day and headed to Sweden for half a week and I just haven\u0026rsquo;t had free time and energy to write at the same moment since!\n\nSo Emily and I met up in Paris in what I now will call the \u0026ldquo;flu game of vacations\u0026rdquo;. Confused? See Michael Jordan Flu Game. Somehow, despite being pretty under the weather, Emily let me drag her around to basically every major thing-to-see in Paris in the span of three days! We started off Friday at Musée d\u0026rsquo;Orsay because it was new for both of us and it had come highly recommended. Some people I know pretty well even said they spent SEVEN hours there one time ;-). We saw an awesome Degas exhibit, I was a big fan of the horse sculptures.\n  We ventured into the huge hall of impressionist art, definitely the area we were most excited to see! I was pretty proud of myself for recognizing a lot of the artists names and even some specific paintings! I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we have a magnet of this one on the fridge back home\u0026hellip;\n One of multiple art magnets   Some of my other favorites was this one by Caillebotte and these church paintings by Monet. They looked to me like a big church made out of dripping candle wax.\n Monet!   We also took a selfie with another fridge magnet from back home!  Alternative Instagram caption: 3 people, 5 ears.   After Orsay we crossed the river again and went to an apparently new-ish Paris attraction, the Ferris wheel! The view was too good to waste time taking pictures but we could see everything from the top - the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and finally the Eiffel Tower! Definitely would recommend the Ferris wheel, unless you\u0026rsquo;re with someone who keeps asking you \u0026ldquo;what would you do if this thing tipped over right now\u0026rdquo;.\n Big on the selfies   Spotted: A little slice of Charlottesville in France!\n TJ in Paris!   Also on Friday, stopped by Angelina\u0026rsquo;s for the hot chocolate - WOW, that is definitely the most fancy place I\u0026rsquo;ve been just to have a hot chocolate! They had full on waiters and white tables inside a beautiful room just for these drinks! Also that was definitely not American hot chocolate (chocolate and milk). That was literally hot. melted. chocolate. We apparently were supposed to add sugar ourselves in case the chocolate wasn\u0026rsquo;t sweet enough but I was afraid I might spontaneously get diabetes if I did that.\nSaturday morning we tried to hit a \u0026ldquo;great weekend brunch\u0026rdquo; recommendation only to find out that they only have said \u0026ldquo;great weekend bunch\u0026rdquo; on Sundays!! So, by this time it was French lunch time apparently and we ended up with escargot on our plates for our first meal of the day. Bon Appétit.\n First escargot experience was actually really good!! They really made you work to get it out of the shell   Saturday was a little unfortunate because it rained literally the whole day, but we still made the most of it and saw the Jardin du Luxembourg, Notre Dame, and Sainte Chappelle. Sainte Chappelle was absolutely amazing to me, the fact that over 70% of the stained glass in that church was almost 1000 years old. Notre Dame was massive but also the most touristy church I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen! Very strange to see shops and stores right next to church pews.\n Beautiful stained glass tells has a different picture in each pane    Notre Dame! Absolutely massive   We also checked out Shakespeare and Company book store right near the two churches. It was full of probably thousands of books and every room was shaped a little differently, which I thought was really interesting. It used to house famous writers, Ernest Hemingway lived there for a bit!\nAt night we finally hit the main attraction and went up in the Eiffel Tower! Even though we got there too late and could only go up to the second level, the view was still great and the light show while up there was stunning! I definitely think the Tower looks better at night.\n No caption needed    On the tower for the light show!   Exhausted from two days of nonstop walking and sightseeing, we of course had to power through on Sunday and climb up to the highest point in Paris, Montmartre! There we got an amazing view of the city, in the sunlight this time (!!) and went inside Sacré-Cœur, the basilica at the top of the hill. The view, the harp player playing on the steps, and of course the people trying to sell us selfie sticks all made the morning very memorable.\n      Beautiful inside of Sacré-Cœur  Last on our list was the Arc de Triomphe, which we metro\u0026rsquo;ed to but didn\u0026rsquo;t quite have time to go up in before I had to make a mad dash to the airport. Someone\u0026rsquo;s gotta tell these cities to stop building their airports so far outside the city!! I\u0026rsquo;m still so happy about how much we got to see and do over the whole weekend, and the number of awesome food spots we hit too that I don\u0026rsquo;t think I even mentioned too much. There\u0026rsquo;s still so much more to see in Paris, I know the Louvre and the Catacombs will be on my list for the next time around.\n  Quick, we saw the Arc de triompe!  Time to get ready for the next trip - Dublin!\nAu revoir,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"e1ba1c63f7c748c5aea598773dd376c2","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Escargot for Breakfast","type":"article","url":"/article/escargot-for-breakfast/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;d like to start off by announcing that as of yesterday morning, Brady Madden has become a true Dane (kind of). Yesterday morning I became the newest proud renter of a bicycle - possibly the most stereotypical item associated with Danish people along with black clothing! After one day I can already tell this bike is definitely going to change my study abroad experience for the better by a lot.\n\n My new sweet ride   Let me backtrack and tell you a bit more about bike culture in Denmark. It is a way of life here, plain and simple. Everybody\u0026rsquo;s doing it. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen adults in work clothes commuting on bikes; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen small children biking next to their parents; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen bikes of all shapes and sizes - some with strollers attached to the back or to the front; I\u0026rsquo;ve seen women biking with their child in a seat on the handlebars. I\u0026rsquo;ve even seen a man biking while rolling a second bike next to him down the road.\nBut for the first two weeks I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know if I wanted to get a bike for myself. Like I\u0026rsquo;ve said in previous posts, I live in the center of the city, less than a 5 minute walk from class, and have successfully taken the metro, train, and bus to farther out locations when needed. What do I really need a bike for? However, in these two weeks I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten the same feeling I get on Madden Family Vacations\u0026trade;. That feeling where we\u0026rsquo;re out all day exploring every nook and cranny of wherever we are, fitting as many activities as we can in, and making the most of every day. Part of that I\u0026rsquo;ve been attributing to the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m going to be in this country for 120 days instead of 7, giving me more time to spread out each excursion. Part of it might be the weather (still below 40 here every day, and never sunny). But I think a large part of it was just the fact that walking to explore is tough, it takes a while, and most people don\u0026rsquo;t like to do it for very long! Getting a bike was less about serving a utilitarian purpose for me, and more about encouraging my friends and I to get out and explore.\nSo for $80 for the whole semester, Daniel and I became renters of bicycles yesterday, and proceeded to ride around the city for the next 3 hours or so. It was exactly what I needed. The first 30 minutes or so on the bikes were just us being giddy about how much ground we were covering, and how much faster we were doing it than if we had been walking. We were getting the hang of the written and unwritten rules of the road, and marveling at how every road in Copenhagen was designed with bikes in mind. Every street has two wide, seperate bike lanes - no sharing the road with cars like in America. Bicyclists are treated like first class citizens here: people look both ways before crossing a bike lane and cars wait to turn right to see if anyone is biking straight down the lane next to them.\n Rosenborg Castle! Complete with guards with AKs     We biked over to the Rosenborg Slot, the castle that holds a lot of Denmark\u0026rsquo;s crown jewels. It was too late to go inside but it was cool to see a castle complete with a moat near the center of the city. We also checked out the lakes - Copenhagen has 5 man-made rectangular lakes and its about 4 miles around the whole lot. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely excited to run around there once it gets warmer. By this point we learned that gloves were definitely a necessity for biking because my hands were cold from all the wind. Later on in the evening it was time to warm up at CopenHOT, a outdoor hottub tourist attraction on the harbor. With our new bikes, 6 of us ventured out for a 25 minute ride to one of the neighboring islands of Copenhagen proper for our 6 PM reservation. After 15 minutes we\u0026rsquo;d left the main part of the city and gone past the opera house. After 20 minutes we were surrounded by shipping crates and in the center of what looked like a large energy plant. It was dark, we\u0026rsquo;re on bikes, we\u0026rsquo;re in an empty, dimly-lit, industrial, energy plant area \u0026ndash; we basically became the cast of Stranger Things. That\u0026rsquo;s when my bike chain decided to fall off.\n View from Kastellet, a star-shaped, moat-surrounded, old military base   I was pretty sure I was going to have to walk this bike all the way home but luckily one of the guys was able to fix it and we were back on our way down this desolate road which we assumed at some point was going to lead to a large hot tub party business?? Finally we reached the end of the road, according to Google Maps, and found ourselves in a gravel parking lot with one single lamp and no hot tubs in sight. This was pretty much the perfect place to be murdered \u0026ndash; although sidenote to Mom, Copenhagen is probably safer than sleepy Charlottesville, people leave their babies unattended in strollers on the sidewalk. When we called the CopenHOT man, he directed us to the true location, basically around the corner of one of the shipping containers, and it was definitely a cute little setup. There were some colored lights strung across a few little dressing room buildings, and multiple hot tubs set up right next to the harbor, with real fires burning underneath them to heat the water! The water, we learned, was saltwater straight from the harbor, and not only could we sit in the hot tub, but if it got too hot we could cool off by jumping in the harbor. The dockworkers made fun of us until we agreed to do it and let me tell you 4 degrees Celsius water is no joke. We met the owner of CopenHOT, a super cool middle-aged man from Iceland, who went from random guy who works at a hot tub place in the outskirts of Copenhagen to millionaire business owner fluent in Arabic who\u0026rsquo;s been recruited by the CIA and opened CopenHOT because his cushy job was \u0026ldquo;too boring\u0026rdquo; in about 10 minutes of conversation. I was in awe.\n\u0026hellip;\nAlso this week: my danish class and I visited a real Danish gymnasium, which is not what it means in english! A gymnasium in Denmark is a three-year school for students around ages 16-19 before they move on to university. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about the Danish education system since I\u0026rsquo;ve started this class and I\u0026rsquo;m still undecided on if it\u0026rsquo;s better than the US system but it certainly is different and definitely has its perks. Danish students start getting paid to go to school starting at age 18 AND their schooling is free! That right off the bat was enough to make my classes\u0026rsquo; jaws drop. We also got to meet and talk to a bunch of students in an English class about the differences between American and Danish education. These kids are really responsible for their own education path, and they don\u0026rsquo;t follow the normal path from middle school to high school to college like all American kids do. If they don\u0026rsquo;t feel ready for the next level, they can take a few gap years or work or do a 10th year of high school, etc. I was definitely impressed at how mature these kids seemed about their education decisions \u0026ndash; it would be really stressful in America to not be doing the same thing as all your peers even if it was the best thing for yourself. On the flip side, they were super intrigued by some things we take for granted as normal in America \u0026ndash; the whole class was stunned at the fact that \u0026ldquo;if two kids are applying for a job and one is better than the other but the lesser candidate\u0026rsquo;s dad works at the company, he will get the job.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile the American students kind of just shrugged and laughed. I was actually pretty sad to leave the Danish students, I could have talked to them all day about all the differences between our lives and theirs! I was also just really impressed with their English skills.\n DIS Danish and Nørre gymnasium english class!    Frederik's Kirke   Later on Wednesday my Danish group visited Amalienborg, where the Queen of Denmark lives, to look around for our cultural assignment. We got to see the changing of the guard right as we walked into the main royal square! It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting how close we could get to the Queen\u0026rsquo;s building compared to the White House. We also saw the Opera house from across the harbor and ate at the first smørrebrød place, Ida Davidsen. This is where I learned that smørrebrød comes in so many different shapes, sizes, and flavors! It\u0026rsquo;s less of rye bread with a cream cheese-like spread on top and more of rye bread with literally anything on top. Mine this time was roast beef, potatoes, grilled onions, and some kind of sauce! It was a lot fancier than the one I had in the Louisiana art museum.\n Royal Square    Ida Davidsen, the first ever smørrebrød spot    Can you spot the bread underneath all that!?   I\u0026rsquo;m finally finishing this so many days later than I started but I\u0026rsquo;ll have to write about my weekend travels in another post! Also some trip planning is finally happening and I\u0026rsquo;ll be in Paris this weekend!!\nHej hej (Bye),\nBrady\nP.S. Check out this \u0026ldquo;Margharita Pizza\u0026rdquo; I ordered the other night\u0026hellip; is this a joke!!!\n One lonely tomato   ","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"94e735be503f73632f5a25dd1641ef69","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Becoming a Dane 101","type":"article","url":"/article/becoming-a-dane-101/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"There\u0026rsquo;s been so much to write about here but frankly, just not enough quiet, alone time to do it! My apartment has kept me very busy but I\u0026rsquo;m thankful I\u0026rsquo;ve met some people that are really into going out and having a good time. My wallet is uncertain how it feels after quite an expensive first week. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely glad it\u0026rsquo;s Sunday and pretty much nobody has an excuse to go out tonight.\nLike I mentioned in the last post, I live literally in the center of the city. Charlottesville has the corner, the strip of bars all in very close proximity to each other where everyone goes out \u0026ndash; I basically live on the corner of Copenhagen - but with about 10x as many bars, and a bunch of clubs. Most of which close far after 2AM. Cue Adam and I sadly sitting awake at 4:30 last night listening to the club music 30 feet from our beds. We\u0026rsquo;ve been able to hit a bunch of different bars in our direct area and have even started venturing out past the nearby streets where the bars are less Americanized and more authentic \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m really enjoying trying to meet Danes and they always are so intrigued by Americans! A lot of them can\u0026rsquo;t understand why I would leave America to come to Denmark for a semester.\n\n My room! My corner is the one in the middle.\nThose blackout curtains have been helping us sleep in till noon.   Since my last post, I\u0026rsquo;ve completed my first - and only - day of class here. It\u0026rsquo;s quite weird being here for over a week now and having spent less than 5 hours doing anything school related! My first class on Thursday was at 11:40 AM and I was able to get up and work out at the gym in the morning beforehand which made me feel really productive. I was again so thankful for my location when I left my apartment at 11:31 to walk to class, and learned others had ridden trains for over 40 minutes! I\u0026rsquo;m sure my life would be a lot different this semester if I lived that far away.\nAnyways, my first class was Danish and we started by talking about some of the biggest culture shocks we\u0026rsquo;ve faced so far. I mentioned how the transit systems here are kind of on the honor system and how that definitely would never work in America. Here, you have a transit card with money on it that you tap on a sensor as you board and depart any metro, train, or bus around the city. It\u0026rsquo;s a great system that is very easy and transitions well between all the different modes of transportation. The interesting thing is, there isn\u0026rsquo;t any turnstiles or barriers blocking you from taking the transportation without paying! Ticket-checkers will occasionally come by and make sure you actually \u0026ldquo;tapped-on\u0026rdquo; but I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a lot yet and I know I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally taken at least one ride without paying. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the statistics of how many Danes free-load off the transportation here but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I could say that this system would fail in the States. Back in class, we also learned about some \u0026ldquo;culture no-no\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; in Denmark. Some interesting ones I learned:\n Danes do not like to chit-chat like Americans. They say \u0026ldquo;Hej\u0026rdquo; (Hi) and expect the same in return - different than America where we usually say \u0026ldquo;Hey, how are you doing?\u0026rdquo; just to be polite. Catharina (my professor), said that if we ask a Dane how they are doing, expect them to actually answer the question with a long response! Professors here want to be called by their first name. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s disrespectful to call them \u0026ldquo;Professor\u0026rdquo;. Danes really don\u0026rsquo;t like people who talk loudly, or really at all, on public transportation. Avoid yawning (I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what to think of this one because yawning is kind of an involutary reflex, but I had yawned like five times in her class already so I felt bad when I heard this) Ask dog owners permission to pet their dog before doing so. They think it\u0026rsquo;s very strange for strangers to be touching their dog!  Later that night, all I could do is shake my head as the people around me violated basically every \u0026ldquo;culture no-no\u0026rdquo; on this list! I almost laughed out loud when a kid started petting a woman\u0026rsquo;s dog on the street and she just stared at him in alarm. Sorry, we\u0026rsquo;re just clueless Americans!\nFriday night we decided to treat ourselves and go out to eat for dinner, because, we hadn\u0026rsquo;t put a big enough dent in our bank accounts or anything yet right? Daniel, Nate, Justin and I walked down Strøget to Mama Rosa, since we all were craving mexican food. I got a pretty great enchilada and tried my first Moscow Mule! We were all very disappointed they did not come in the copper mugs as I expected. I really appreciated Dad\u0026rsquo;s words of wisdom on the drink - \u0026ldquo;Be careful, a few of those will kick you in the ass (like a mule!)\u0026rdquo;. Good line, but no way was I paying for a few of those.\n Mama Rosa meal. I was a big fan of the cucumber in the drink!   After dinner, we met up with some more friends back at our apartment and eventually decided to venture out to the Meatpacking district of Copenhagen, to try out a club. The Meatpacking district is about 20 minutes southwest of the center of the city and we ended up at KB3 for my first Scandinavian club experience. This night ended up being probably one of the highlights of my nights out in Copenhagen so far - the DJs played some amazing Scandinavian music mixed in with some classic American songs, the lights and smoke effects were absolutely unreal and it felt like I was at an adult version of high school homecoming - which now that I write that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it really comes across as cool, but you\u0026rsquo;ll have to take my word for it that it was fun!\nThe next day I and others were itching to be tourists and not just college kids at bars during these four months so we hopped on the S-Tøg and trained about 45 minutes up the coast to Humlebæk to see the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. This museum was featured as one of the top-5 day trips from Copenhagen and it in fact has nothing to do with the Louisiana we in the US know. It\u0026rsquo;s namesake, I learned, is the three wives the founder of the museum had, all who were named Louise! The museum was right on the water and we actually could see Sweden across the way. It was the first time I\u0026rsquo;d seen water, grass, or really nature in general in a week and wow I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how much I needed it! Once we went inside there were some awesome exhibits and some very strange ones, including this \u0026ldquo;Anamazon\u0026rdquo; one which was literally a pile of dirt surrounded by 27 Amazon echos. The blue-green light inside the room was painful and the whole vibe was very creepy.\n Beautiful view with Sweden in the background. So nice to get out of the city for a bit.    This exhibit gave me nightmares. The Alexas were reading out every single product on Amazon in alphabetical order.   We also saw an Andy Warhol painting and a mesmerizing infinite-mirror light display. Afterwards, Daniel, Nate and I tried Denmark\u0026rsquo;s signature dish, smørrebrød, for the first time and it was not what I was expecting. I had heard smørrebrød was an open-faced sandwich, so I was expecting a regular sandwich with toppings and just the top bun missing for an unknown reason. Instead, this dish was more like rye bread with a heavy cream cheese-like spread that you put on the rye. The spread has different meats and vegetables mixed in and ours was a smoked salmon base. I was skeptical by the initial visual and I\u0026rsquo;m sure my Mom would absolutely hate it, but it was surpringly good! I was proud of myself for checking another Danish speciality off the list.\n Kusama Installation. We only were allowed a minute in here it was so popular!    Smoked Salmon Smørrebrød!    Andy Warhol   Humlebæk was a super interesting town and all the houses were exactly what I would expect from a small, Nordic village. It was pretty unreal to think about where I was and how just a week ago I was in my house in Centreville!\nI\u0026rsquo;m still looking forward to my Paris trip in a little less than two weeks and we\u0026rsquo;re possibly looking at taking the train to Stockholm next weekend! Copenhagen is great but the less weekend nights I sleep across from that club may be for the better!!\n#1 American thing I\u0026rsquo;m missing right now: definitely watching some college basketball, but UVA is still doing well!\nTill next time,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"25456b345457d2777fa8a408e0b704c2","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"The City that Never Sleeps, or is that just me?","type":"article","url":"/article/the-city-that-never-sleeps/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"Hello from across the pond!\nIt has been a whirlwind first five-ish days in Copenhagen and I decided I needed to finally sit down and write about everything that\u0026rsquo;s happened before I forget! This is probably going to be too long but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to start with the basics:\n\nHousing\nI live in an apartment complex of all DIS students in the center of the city - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a name like a lot of the apartments in Charlottesville so we just call it by the street name: Skindergade. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure nobody has really figured out the correct pronunciation but I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about 50 different ones.\nThe complex is an interesting, almost-donut-shaped building with a tiny courtyard in the center that nobody would probably go in even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t 35 degrees outside. Each of the 5 levels has a communal kitchen and bathroom, and maybe 2 or 3 rooms. I\u0026rsquo;m on the ground floor, first door as you walk in. It\u0026rsquo;s really great because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to carry giant suitcases up the dollhouse-sized stairs. It\u0026rsquo;s really rough when I hear every single person walk in and out of the apartment. The Danish make their doors sturdy. And loud.\nSpeaking of my room, I\u0026rsquo;m in a triple - and the only triple I think I\u0026rsquo;ve heard of yet. I was really excited to hear about it and still am because I lucked out with two really nice guys. Adam is from Vandy and Nic is from Wisconsin. We have a second room in the back half of the ground floor with two guys from Georgetown and GW, and these two rooms are connected by our kitchen.\nSince the entrance to my room is near the front of the building and the main entrance to Matt and Nathaniel\u0026rsquo;s room is in the back, people pretty much always come and go through our door. Sometimes I feel like I sleep in a hallway.\nHowever, all-in-all, I definitely lucked out with housing. Walking out my door into the center of Copenhagen, being steps from class, and living with a bunch of nice guys is a great deal. I definitely think this location will make a lot of things a lot easier as the semester goes on. Things like\u0026hellip;\nExploring\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done a decent job of walking around and starting to learn the city so far, although I can\u0026rsquo;t really compare to the number of hours and miles walked during Madden family vacations! Luckily, I have four months here so I can space everything out a bit more.\nSunday was the first full day in the city, and our planned morning activity was a city scavenger hunt with our apartment complex. A few guys from my dorm and I ventured out to grab coffee beforehand at around 10 and the city was a ghost town! The streets were so silent I thought maybe we were breaking some Danish morning curfew.\n Strøget on an empty Sunday morning ft. my roommate Nic   The scavenger hunt had us wander around the city in hopes of gettings us familiar with our immediate neighborhood, and maybe some public transportation we could use. My group ended up hopping on a bus that took us in the exact opposite direction of our house for about 10 minutes before finally reaching the next stop. We must have crossed three different bodies of water in that bus ride and all my group could do was look out the window in dispair and think about the 30 degree temperature waiting for us on our now much longer walk back.\nLuckily, there were transit maps on the bus and let me tell you, the Danish put their 46.8% tax rate to good use by building a killer public transportation system! We hopped on the metro and in two stops we were back in the center of the city for a total of 12 kroner - otherwise known as 2 dollars. That thing made the DC metro look like it was designed and operated by a monkey.\nAlso during the scavenger hunt, we happened upon probably the most unusual thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far in Copenhagen:\n Your browser does not support the video tag.   I don\u0026rsquo;t have much more to say about it because I have no idea what its purpose is, but they were marching the next day too!\nHighlight of the day: \u0026ldquo;winning\u0026rdquo; the scavenger hunt and a 500 kroner gift card to Conditori La Glace: \u0026ldquo;the oldest and probably best confectionary in Denmark\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely excited to go check that out with my group and celebrate!\nMonday we headed over to Christiania, which is a neighborhood of Copenhagen, to walk around and test our metro skills a bit. It was still bitter cold that day and I began to question if I\u0026rsquo;d ever see the sun again.\n Beautiful canals of Christiania   Tuesday morning I ventured out on my own to wander around for a bit. We live right next to Strøget, the mile-long cobblestone shopping street that runs through the city. It is basically a window-shopper\u0026rsquo;s paradise and I can see a lot of money being spent their this semester.\nI ended up at the foot of Rundetaarn, a round tower attached to the back of a church. The views and potential pictures were screaming my name so I headed up the windy ramp. The views from the top definitely did not disappoint!\n Views from Rundetaarn  Spiraling ramp up to the top of Rundetaarn   ... This is more words in one place than my simple engineering brain can handle so we\u0026rsquo;re gonna move on to\u0026hellip;\nFinal Thoughts\nI\u0026rsquo;ve officially caught the travel fever, I think we all have. I have heard \u0026ldquo;I just spent the last 2 hours looking at flights to everywhere\u0026rdquo; at least 10 times in 5 days.\nSpeaking of travel, I\u0026rsquo;ve booked my first trip: Emily and I are meeting in Paris on Febuary 2nd to 4th! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to drag her to all the super touristy spots that she\u0026rsquo;s seen already :-)\nIt is not an exaggeration by any means that Danish people only wear black. I have a navy blue coat and I might as well be wearing neon for how much I feel like I stand out. Black is not dark clothes. Black is not navy, or dark green, or grey. Everyone wears black.\nGuessing at Danish words and their meaning is not a good idea. On my first food order I tried to be clever and order the \u0026ldquo;Pesto Sandwich\u0026rdquo; because the menu item said the words \u0026ldquo;pesto\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;brød\u0026rdquo; (bread). After 5 minutes of confusion the cashier was able to figure out what I was talking about and told me that menu item was actually \u0026ldquo;pasta salad\u0026rdquo;. Oops.\nFreezing on the tarmac in Amsterdam, amongst a bunch of foreigners, thousands of miles away from pretty much anyone you know makes you question what you got yourself into for the next four months.\n Contemplating life as I stand in the freezing wind   Danes may be the calmest people on the planet. We spent twenty minutes signing five people up for gym memberships and the next guy in line waited quietly the whole time to buy a protein bar. In America, I get mad about a slow customer ahead of me after about 30 seconds.\nOther proud accomplishment: successfully buying a SIM card and signing up for a phone plan that gives me 30 gigabytes of data for the month all for less than 30 dollars! Where can I get that plan back in the US\u0026hellip;\nTLDR\nRead it all! Life is good, Copenhagen is cold, beautiful, and expensive, class starts tomorrow and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to keep exploring and start traveling!\nTill next time,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"147e1843cfa7a14855db8f3f0c8499cc","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Welcome to Copenhagen","type":"article","url":"/article/welcome-to-copenhagen/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Study Abroad"],"content":"The day has finally come to say goodbye to America for four months and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure my brain still doesn\u0026rsquo;t know I\u0026rsquo;m leaving or where I\u0026rsquo;m going yet. But here I am, terminal C of Dulles Airport. The international terminal.\n\nFor those unaware or maybe only semi-aware of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing until May, I\u0026rsquo;m headed to Copenhagen, Denmark to study at DIS - a Danish school for American college students. So maybe more like an extended European vacation with a side of coding assignments and intro-level Danish langauge classes? Three days of class and no Friday courses is really going to make that return to UVA in the fall pretty tough.\nAll kidding aside, my expectations for this semester are rising as fast as this plane I\u0026rsquo;m about to board. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to experiencing the largest culture shock of my life, learning to communicate in a foreign country, taking thousands of pictures, and finally learning how to pronounce the word \u0026ldquo;Beer\u0026rdquo; in Danish. It is spelled \u0026ldquo;øl\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m at a loss trying to sound that one out.\nIn addition to becoming a veteran of Copenhagen, I want to visit London, Paris, Berlin, Iceland, Norway, Budapest, Amsterdam, Cinque Terre, Lisbon, Ireland\u0026hellip;! Who knows how feasible that is, but like I said, expectations are high. Some of those southern countries are a must since Copenhagen has an average temperature hovering around freezing and gets basically no daylight in the winter. At least I\u0026rsquo;ve finally found the place where my pale skin won\u0026rsquo;t stand out so much! These are my people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really so thankful to be able to take this experience and I\u0026rsquo;m looking to make the absolute most out of every day, and every bite of Smørrebrød (some kind of Danish sandwich with bread on only one side! No wonder Europeans are so much healthier than Americans). I can\u0026rsquo;t say a big enough thank you to my parents for helping me make this happen in every way - even driving a Uhaul to Charlottesville and moving my queen-sized bed out of my 5th floor apartment didn\u0026rsquo;t crush this dream.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll miss Charlottesville and UVa a ton, all the people there and the awesome events in the spring. But you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to find me up at 2AM cheering on UVa basketball from six hours ahead!\nLooking forward to the experience of a lifetime\u0026hellip;\nIndtil næste gang,\nBrady\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"5009bc11f7fb591b3c38a95952cef507","tags":["Study Abroad"],"title":"Its Happening","type":"article","url":"/article/its-happening/"},{"author":"Brady Madden","categories":["Projects","Go","Art","Quad heaps","Open source"],"content":"Go-quads was a project I started after finding a similar algorithmic art program online, by @fogleman. I loved the idea of a program being able to create something that looked like art, algorithmically, and was looking for a way to replicate it myself.\n\n\nI decided to use Go as the language after being exposed to it for the first time at work, and was hoping to learn more. The project definitely had its fair share of challenges, and I worked through a few different iterations in order to make it as efficient as I could.\nThe general process behind the art is to take in an image and calculate the average pixel color across the entire image. That color is replaces the image area, acting as if the image was severely blurred. The algorithm iterates by splitting the original image into 4 equal quadrants and calculating each quadrant\u0026rsquo;s average pixel color, then replacing that quadrant\u0026rsquo;s image with the color.\n Once the total image has at least 4 quadrants, the error between the average pixel color and the actual pixel values is calculated for each quadrant and the quadrant with the largest error is quad-split again.\nTo keep track of the current quadrant with the largest pixel error I stored each image struct in a heap. The image structs hold data about the dimensions of the quadrant image, the average pixel color, and the upper-left point of the quadrant in relation to the main image.\nIn addition, each image struct contains a histogram of the RGBA values of each pixel in the quadrant. Storing this array of integers performed faster than storing actual sub-images and extracting pixel values each iteration.\nThe total quadrant pixel error is derived by using the following formula across across the quadrant pixel histogram:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^p (r_i - \\overline{r})^2 + (g_i - \\overline{g})^2 + (b_i - \\overline{b})^2 $$\nwhere $p$ is the number of pixels in the quadrant, $\\overline{r}$, $\\overline{g}$, and $\\overline{b}$ are the average RGB values of the quadrant.\nAfter each iteration, the new quadrants are superimposed over the current main image at the correct position corresponding to the upper-left point stored in the quadrant image struct.\nGo-quads is compiled as an executable program that can be run with flags specifying certain parameters such as the number of iterations to run the quad-splitting algorithm, border, and background colors.\n\nAn additional feature is the ability to display the quadrants as circles instead of squares. Instead of drawing an entire quadrant with one average pixel color, the pixels in the quadrant will be given one of two designations - inside the radius or outside the radius. Pixels inside the radius will be colored with the average pixel color for that quadrant and pixels outside the radius will be colored with the background color.\nThis project produced some really interesting images and was definitely a good learning experience with Go and image processing.
